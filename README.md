# Task Objective

The main goal of this task is for each student to gain a clear understanding of the role certificates and the PKI subsystem play in a distributed software system, how they integrate with it, and what complications and issues arise in this context.

# System purpose
Admin can centrally issue certificates for digital entities in the system. This includes issuing self-signed certificates, intermediate certificates (CA), and end-entity certificates. Considerations include preventing the storage of private keys on the PKI system for end-entity certificates, allowing keys to be generated externally or auto-generated by the PKI system without storage. Templates for certificates should define extensions and the certificate's purpose, simplifying data entry for administrators. Admins need visibility into all certificates within the system. PKI should validate certificates based on issuer selection, expiration dates, and best practice security configurations. Admins can revoke certificates, with PKI providing certificate status verification services using CRL or OCSP techniques.
